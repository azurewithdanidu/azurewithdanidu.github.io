Azure Virtual Network Manager is a new networking service from Microsoft that enables you to manage and govern virtual networks across multiple subscriptions, regions, and clouds. With Virtual Network Manager, you can easily create and manage network connectivity, security, and policy across your entire Azure estate.

## When to Use Azure Virtual Network Manager

Azure Virtual Network Manager is ideal for organizations that manage multiple virtual networks in Azure and need a centralized way to manage network connectivity, security, and policy. Here are some scenarios where Virtual Network Manager can be particularly useful:

### Multi-Region Deployments

If you have virtual networks deployed across multiple regions, Virtual Network Manager can help you manage network connectivity and security policies across all regions from a single location.

### Multi-Subscription Deployments

If you have virtual networks deployed across multiple subscriptions, Virtual Network Manager can help you manage network connectivity and security policies across all subscriptions from a single location.

### Hybrid Deployments

If you have virtual networks deployed both on-premises and in Azure, Virtual Network Manager can help you manage network connectivity and security policies across both environments.

### Large-Scale Deployments

If you have a large number of virtual networks, Virtual Network Manager can help you manage network connectivity and security policies at scale, reducing the time and effort required to manage individual virtual networks.

## Key Features

Virtual Network Manager offers several key features that make it an essential tool for managing Azure networks:

### Network Groups

Network groups allow you to group virtual networks together based on common criteria, such as location, function, or owner. Once you've created a network group, you can apply network policies to all the virtual networks in the group, making it easy to manage network security and connectivity across multiple networks.

### Network Policies

Network policies enable you to define and enforce network security and connectivity rules across your virtual networks. With network policies, you can:

- Control traffic flow between virtual networks

- Define firewall rules to allow or deny traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols

- Apply network policies to multiple virtual networks at once

- Use Azure Policy to enforce network policies across your entire Azure environment

### Global Reach

Global Reach enables you to extend your virtual network connectivity beyond a single region. With Global Reach, you can connect virtual networks in different regions using Azure's private backbone, providing low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity between virtual networks.

### Network Connectivity

Virtual Network Manager provides several options for network connectivity, including:

- Virtual network peering: Connect virtual networks within the same region or across regions

- VPN Gateway: Connect on-premises networks to Azure virtual networks using a VPN gateway

- ExpressRoute: Connect on-premises networks to Azure virtual networks using a dedicated private network connection

- Azure Private Link: Connect to Azure services over a private connection, bypassing public internet

## Getting Started

To get started with Azure Virtual Network Manager, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and create a new Virtual Network Manager instance.

3. Create a network group and add virtual networks to the group.

5. Define network policies and apply them to the network group.

7. Configure network connectivity options as needed.

9. Monitor and manage your virtual networks using Virtual Network Manager.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices for using Azure Virtual Network Manager:

- Use network groups to group virtual networks based on common criteria, such as location, function, or owner.

- Use network policies to define and enforce network security and connectivity rules across multiple virtual networks.

- Use Azure Policy to enforce network policies across your entire Azure environment.

- Use Global Reach to extend virtual network connectivity beyond a single region.

- Use virtual network peering, VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute, or Azure Private Link to connect virtual networks to on-premises networks or Azure services.

- Monitor virtual networks using Virtual Network Manager to ensure network health and performance.

## Conclusion

Azure Virtual Network Manager is a powerful new networking service that makes it easy to manage and govern virtual networks across multiple subscriptions, regions, and clouds. With its key features, such as network groups, network policies, global reach, and network connectivity options, Virtual Network Manager is an essential tool for managing Azure networks. By following best practices, you can ensure that your virtual networks are secure, performant, and easy to manage.
