Microsoft Azure has unveiled the public preview of its new Dnldnen v6 Virtual Machines, powered by the 5th Generation Intel Xeon processors—setting a new standard for performance, scalability, and efficiency in the cloud. This launch is a major milestone for organizations seeking to run demanding workloads, from enterprise databases to next-generation AI, with greater speed and security.

## **What’s New with Azure Dnldnen v6 VMs?**

The Dnldnen v6 VMs introduce a suite of enhancements over previous generations, including:

- **5th Gen Intel Xeon Power:** These VMs leverage the latest Intel Xeon “Emerald Rapids” processors, offering up to 30% higher per-core performance compared to prior generations

- **Scalability:** Support for up to 128 vCPUs (Dv6) and 192 vCPUs (Ev6), with memory options scaling to 1.8 TiB, making them ideal for both general-purpose and memory-intensive workloads

- **AI and Analytics Acceleration:** With Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX), the new VMs deliver up to 4x faster AI inference, significantly boosting performance for machine learning and generative AI tas

- **NVMe Storage & Azure Boost:** Enhanced storage throughput and IOPS with NVMe interfaces for both local and remote disks, plus Azure Boost technology for up to 400k IOPS and 12 GB/s remote storage throughput

- **Next-Gen Networking:** The new Microsoft Azure Network Adaptor (MANA) provides up to 200 Gbps bandwidth and forward-compatible drivers for Windows and Linux

- **Enhanced Security:** Intel Total Memory Encryption (TME) protects data in system memory, while upcoming support for Intel Trusted Domain Extensions (TDX) will further bolster confidential computing

## **Why Does This Matter?**

The Dnldnen v6 VMs are engineered for the most demanding enterprise applications:

- **General Computing:** Dv6 VMs deliver balanced CPU and memory for web front ends, e-commerce, and desktop virtualization

- **Data-Intensive Workloads:** Ev6 VMs are purpose-built for large in-memory databases like SAP HANA, supporting massive datasets and high-throughput analytics

- **AI and ML:** The integration of Intel AMX means faster model training and inference, unlocking new possibilities for AI-driven insights and automation

## **Performance in Action**

Benchmarks and customer feedback highlight the step-change in capability:

> “The Esv6 VMs combine high storage throughput and network bandwidth, critical for heavy database workloads. These VMs enable the use of FlashGrid Cluster for very large Oracle RAC databases of 100+ TB in size.”  
> – Art Danielov, CEO, FlashGrid Inc

Internal tests show up to 30% performance improvement in web applications, databases, analytics, and generative AI tasks, with single-core performance gains of over 28% compared to previous generations

## **The Bottom Line**

With the preview of Dnldnen v6 VMs, Azure customers can now access the latest in cloud compute innovation—delivering more power, better efficiency, and advanced security for every workload. Whether you’re modernizing enterprise applications, scaling AI initiatives, or running mission-critical databases, the new v6 generation provides a robust foundation for the future.
